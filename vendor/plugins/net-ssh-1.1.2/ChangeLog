	* Add a "lenient-host-key-verifier" which is used by default,
	  and which tries to detect whether a connection is being
	  tunnelled and if so will not try to verify the host key.

2007-04-11 00:21  jamis

	* tweak the host key verifier, so that instead of prompting,

2005-02-06 15:57  jamis

	  which it was copied). Version bumped to 1.0.0.

2005-02-01 12:20  jamis

	* Allow a password to be specified programatically for
	  keyboard-interactive. This allows keyboard-interactive to be
	  used in many cases just like 'password'.

2005-01-25 11:44  jamis

	* All tests (except the integration tests) pass on Windows
	  now. Perhaps even some of the random "corrupted hmac" errors
	  I've seen occur on occassion will be fixed now...

2005-01-25 07:54  jamis

	* Removed extraneous whitespace between list items.

2005-01-14 15:28  jamis

	* Channels now respect their own local window and maximum
	  packet sizes, and report reasonable values to the server.
	  This fixes a bug that caused problems when large quantities
	  of data were requested of the server and certain server-
	  maximums were being exceeded.

2005-01-12 10:11  jamis

	* hostbased bug has been (tentatively) squashed

2005-01-12 10:10  jamis

	* Use Socket#close instead of Socket#shutdown. Also, hostname
	  look up is more intelligent and should never raise an
	  exception--it will instead log an error if the hostname
	  absolutely cannot be looked up.

2005-01-12 10:07  jamis

	* The authentication process is now aware of the
	  authentication methods that the server has indicated can
	  possibly succeed. Methods that cannot possibly succeed will
	  no longer even be attempted.

2005-01-12 09:35  jamis

	* Use Socket#close instead of Socket#shutdown in the proxy
	  unit tests. This allows the tests to pass when run in
	  Windows.

2005-01-11 16:21  jamis

	  TODO.

	* Bumped version, updated NEWS, and added more feature
	  demonstrations to the sync-shell-demo.rb script.

2005-01-11 13:46  jamis

	* Added syntax highlighted code blocks, and shell
	  documentation. Also tweaked stylesheets.

2005-01-11 09:07  jamis

	* Simplified the shell service. The 'stdout' and 'stderr',
	  etc. parameters to the service were not working anyway, and
	  may be better implemented as a wrapper around the shell
	  service, anyway.

2005-01-10 16:39  jamis

	* Changed copyright line and author email address.

2005-01-10 16:30  jamis

	* Added SyncShell subservice, reimplemented ssh-client demo,
	  and added demos for both Shell and SyncShell.

2005-01-10 12:50  jamis

	* Added first pass at the shell service, and updated the ssh-
	  client to use it. Also fixed some breakage in the popen3
	  test cases.

2005-01-09 14:14  jamis

	* Keyboard-interactive is correctly implemented now.

2005-01-09 12:17  jamis

	* Getting better at dealing with interactive processes. Added
	  an ssh-client demo.

2005-01-07 13:12  minam

	* Name of the cvs2cl executable changed. Added more TODO's, to keep
	  me busy with.

2005-01-04 20:49  minam

	* Added "host" and "options" attributes to Session (thanks to
	  Daniel Hobe).

2005-01-04 13:17  minam

	* Raise an error if an attempt is made to load a file as a public
	  key, which is not a public key.

2005-01-04 12:27  minam

	* If an agent wasn't running, the authentication would fail with an
	  unhelpful error. This fix should allow authentication to proceed,
	  even in the absense of an ssh-agent.

2004-12-01 22:12  minam

	* Updated NEWS file.

2004-12-01 21:26  minam

	* Pageant support! Fixed documentation. Bumped version to 0.6.0.
	  Added support for external services. The USERNAME environment
	  variable is used if USER is not set. Moved the README to the
	  project root (for consistency with other project files). Fixed
	  some documentation typos.

2004-11-23 13:42  minam

	* Forgot to include the 'examples' subdirectory in the packages.

2004-11-23 13:12  minam

	* Updated TODO (prompter impl was added)

2004-11-23 13:11  minam

	* Added a prompter implementation, instead of depending on
	  ruby-password.

2004-11-23 12:43  minam

	* :verbose and :log options were not being removed from the options
	  before being passed to the transport layer, which was causing the
	  transport layer to fail.

2004-11-23 12:42  minam

	* Oops. :verbosity should have been :verbose.

2004-11-23 12:40  minam

	* Documented the :log and :verbosity options.

2004-11-23 12:37  minam

	* Added examples. Made it easier to customize logging in
	  Net::SSH::Session.

2004-11-23 11:45  minam

2004-11-23 11:29  minam

2004-11-22 13:52  minam

	* Refactored the whole blame thing
