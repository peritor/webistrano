== Welcome to Webistrano on Rails 3 including LDAP authentication



== Getting Started

To install this version just clone the repo into your local directory and run "bundle install". 
This should download all needed dependencies. If you encounter problems check if ruby 1.9.x and bundler
(gem install bundle) are installed.

== Configure Webistrano

To configure webistrano please remove (or copy the files) the sample files in the config dir and edit it accordingly.

== First run

To initialize the database you have to run a rake command. You can execute it via "bundle exec rake db:migrate" this will
execute the migration of the development environment. If you want to migrate or initialize another environment just run
the command like that: "RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:migrate".

To do a dry run you can just execute "script/rails s" and a server should be launched on http://localhost:3000.

== Passenger configuration
